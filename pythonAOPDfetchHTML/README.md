AOPD_Desktops.py is an html image grabber intended for Windows.  It creates a 
folder in the Windows root `ROOT\\Users\\Public\\Pictures\\` directory named
'AOPD_Images' if it does not exist.  It then retrieves the last 20 images from 
the AOPD website and, if it doesn't already exist it saves the image in the
`ROOT\\Users\\Public\\Pictures\\AOPD_Images` directory.  File management for 
maximum capacities will be added soon.
